{
    'slug': 'your-exercise',
    'title': 'üéØ Your Exercise Title',
    'difficulty': 'Beginner',  # or Intermediate, Advanced
    'category': 'Your Category',
    'description': 'Brief description',
    'what_youll_build': 'Detailed description...',
    'patterns': ['hx-get', 'hx-post', ...],
    'requirements': ['Requirement 1', 'Requirement 2', ...],
    'starter_html': '<!-- Your starter template -->',

    'where_to_build': 'Implementation suggestions...',
}
```

### Modifying Existing Exercises

Simply edit the exercise dictionaries in `views.py` - no migrations needed!

## Design Philosophy

- **No tracking**: Focus on learning, not completion metrics
- **Hands-on**: Build in real codebase, not isolated playground
- **Fun themes**: Engaging scenarios make learning enjoyable
- **Combined patterns**: Each exercise teaches multiple concepts
- **Starter templates**: Provide structure without giving answers
- **Progressive hints**: Guide without spoiling the solution

## Team Training Workflow
